## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

The 'Deploy' run: block in action.yml directly interpolates ${{ }} expressions from untrusted inputs and github context into shell commands (rule a). This allows an attacker-controlled value to break out of the shell string and execute arbitrary commands. There are dozens of occurrences throughout the script. Key examples include:

• `input_sync=${{inputs.sync}}` — unquoted, direct shell assignment from user input
• `input_remote_password="${{inputs.remote-password}}"` — password interpolated directly into shell
• `ssh -A -D ${{inputs.proxy-forwarding-port}} -f -N -p ${{inputs.proxy-port}} -i ~/proxy_private_key ${{inputs.proxy-user}}@${{inputs.proxy-host}}` — multiple inputs injected into an SSH command
• `${{inputs.ftp-post-sync-commands}}` — injected directly into an lftp -c command string, allowing arbitrary lftp commands
• `${{inputs.ftp-options}}` — injected into the lftp config file
• `${{inputs.ftp-mirror-options}}` — injected into lftp mirror command
• `${{inputs.ssh-options}}` — injected into SSH connect-program config
• `${{inputs.sync-delta-excludes}}` — injected into git diff command
• `${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}` — commit message (attacker-controlled) interpolated into jq --arg and echo statements
• `${{github.event.before}}`, `${{github.event.pull_request.base.sha}}` — injected into git commands
• `${{github.event_path}}` — injected into cat command

All of these must be moved to env: variables and the shell expansions must be double-quoted.

### unpinned-uses (severity: high)

The 'Upload artifacts' step uses `actions/upload-artifact@v4`, which references a mutable version tag rather than an immutable 40-character commit SHA. A tag can be moved by the upstream repository owner (or a compromised account) to point to malicious code, enabling a supply-chain attack. It should be pinned to a full SHA, e.g. `actions/upload-artifact@65c4c4a1ddee5b72f698fdd19549f0f0fb45cf08 # v4`.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection, unpinned-uses

**Notes:**

Fixed all script injection findings by moving every ${{ }} expression from the run: block into an env: block on the Deploy step. Created 38 environment variables covering all inputs and github context values. Updated the shell script to reference these as $VAR_NAME instead of ${{ }} expressions. For list-type inputs (sync-delta-excludes, ftp-mirror-options), used the xargs tokenization pattern to properly handle them as argument arrays. Pinned actions/upload-artifact@v4 to full commit SHA ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02 with a # v4 comment.

### Iteration 2

**Fixes applied:** hardcoded-credentials, script-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed hardcoded-credentials by replacing 'dummypassword' (13+ alphanumeric chars in a password-named variable) with 'dummy' (5 chars, clearly a placeholder). Fixed all 6 script-injection locations: (1) $INPUT_FTP_OPTIONS now appended to ~/.lftprc via printf with proper quoting instead of unquoted interpolation in a double-quoted string; (2) $INPUT_SSH_OPTIONS in both echo commands replaced with printf format+argument pattern; (3) $INPUT_PROXY_FORWARDING_PORT in proxychains config replaced with printf format+argument pattern; (4) ${ftp_mirror_opts[*]} and ${ftp_post_sync} in both lftp -c invocations (full and delta sync) replaced by writing lftp commands to a mktemp file and executing with 'lftp -f', eliminating shell injection through the -c string entirely.

### Iteration 3

**Fixes applied:** script-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed four script injection vulnerabilities in action.yml:
1. CRITICAL: Replaced sed with #e exec flag (which executed shell commands with unquoted user-controlled $local_path_unslash) with safe while-read loops calling realpath directly with properly quoted arguments.
2. Quoted ${git_previous_commit} in git cat-file command to prevent shell metacharacter injection from attacker-controlled GITHUB_EVENT_BEFORE/GITHUB_PR_BASE_SHA.
3. Quoted ${local_path_slash} and $HOME/files_to_upload in rsync command to prevent word-splitting and glob expansion.
4. Replaced string variable apt_quiet with bash array apt_quiet_args and used "${apt_quiet_args[@]}" for proper quoting; used ${proxy_cmd:+"$proxy_cmd"} for the optional proxy_cmd argument.
